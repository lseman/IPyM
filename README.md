# IPyM
## IPM Solver for BCP in LP

### Description

This project implements an Interior Point Method (IPM) solver for Branch-Cut-Price (BCP) in Linear Programming (LP). It is designed to efficiently solve large-scale LP problems using advanced numerical techniques. The solver is crafted as a library for use in Python, leveraging the capabilities of pybind11.

### Dependencies

    - Eigen: A C++ template library for linear algebra.
    - Cholmod: A library for solving sparse linear systems.
    - pybind11: A lightweight header-only library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice versa.

To ensure full functionality, make sure these dependencies are properly installed and configured in your environment.

### Solving Method

The *AUGMENTED* definition changes the compilation to use an augmented matrix form.

### Installation

    CMake available
